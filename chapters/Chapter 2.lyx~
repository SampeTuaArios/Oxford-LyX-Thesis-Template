The Nature of Dark Energy

\begin_layout Section
Baryon Acoustic Oscillations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Some example text:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the most important issues in cosmology today is determining the propertie
s of dark energy 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Over cosmological distances, dark energy acts as a repulsive force 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Peebles:2003p3088"

\end_inset

 which causes an acceleration in the rate of expansion of the universe,
 an observation first made using distant Type 1A supernovae 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Riess:1998p3211,Perlmutter:1990p3192"

\end_inset

.
 By measuring the rate of expansion, we can learn about the nature of dark
 energy which in turn can reveal a deeper understanding of the standard
 model of cosmology and the origin of the universe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rate of expansion of the universe can be determined from a measurement
 of its size at different epochs.
 A cosmological ‘standard ruler’ 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Blake:2003p3238"

\end_inset

 is an object whose size relative to the universe remains fixed with the
 expansion of the universe.
 One such standard ruler is the typical length scale present in ‘baryon
 acoustic oscillations’ (BAO) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Eisenstein:2005p3244"

\end_inset

.
 These oscillations are the peaks and troughs in the spatial power distribution
 of baryonic matter which correspond to over- and under-densities of matter
 at specific length scales.
 The pressure resulting from over-densities present in the primordial plasma
 after the inflationary period created spherical acoustic waves which radiate
 outward from these over-densities at around half the speed of light.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the Universe expanded and cooled, the electrons and protons eventually
 combined into neutral hydrogen atoms.
 At this point, referred to as recombination, the Universe became essentially
 transparent to photons, removing the outward pressure and effectively freezing
 the matter distribution.
 Over time, some of the dark matter at the centre of the original over-density
 was attracted to the location of the sound horizon 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Eisenstein:2007p3253"

\end_inset

.
 Since the BAO are imprinted into the large-scale structure of the Universe
 they remain unchanged in relation to the size of the Universe.
 The BAO signal was first measured in the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave
 background (CMB) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Hinshaw:2007p3293"

\end_inset

.
 If one could measure the BAO signal at a different epoch this would constitute
 a standard ruler, which would provide a measure of the expansion rate of
 the universe.
