Introduction

\begin_layout Subsection
Fourier Series
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 you can write the Fourier Series:
\begin_inset Formula \[
f(x)=\sum_{-\infty}^{\infty}c_{n}e^{inx},\]

\end_inset

where the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{n}$
\end_inset

are given by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
c_{n}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}f(x)e^{inx}dx\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Maxwell's Equations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are four of the buggers, and I like them in terms of total charge
 and current:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\begin{array}{cc}
\nabla.\mathbf{E}=\frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_{0}} & \nabla\times\mathbf{E}=-\frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial t}\\
\nabla.\mathbf{B}=0 & \nabla\times\mathbf{B}=\mu_{o}\mathbf{J}+\mu_{0}\varepsilon_{0}\frac{\partial\mathbf{E}}{\partial t}\end{array}\]

\end_inset

Where 
\series bold
B 
\series default
is the magnetic field, 
\series bold
E 
\series default
is the electric field and 
\series bold
J 
\series default
is the total current density.
 Also, 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the permittivity of free space (electric constant) and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the permeability of free space (magnetic constant).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's good to know what these mean in words and integral forms, so:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Gauss' Law: 
\emph default
Electric flux through any closed surface is proportional to the enclosed
 electric charge:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Phi=\oint_{S}\mathbf{E}\, d\mathbf{A}=\frac{Q_{enc}}{\varepsilon_{0}}\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Gauss' Magnetic Law: 
\emph default
Magnetic monopoles don't exist:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\oint_{S}\mathbf{B}\, d\mathbf{A}=0\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Faraday's Law of Induction:
\emph default
 The induced electromotive force in any closed circuit is equal to the rate
 of change of the magnetic flux through the circuit:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\epsilon=-\frac{d\Phi_{B}}{dt}\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Ampere's Law: 
\emph default
The relation between integrated magnetic field and current flowing:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\oint_{S}\mathbf{B}\, d\mathbf{\ell}=\mu_{0}I_{enc}\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That should be enough to get you started.
 You should really already know it anyway.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Stokes Parameters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Stokes parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 are related to the amplitudes of perpendicular components of the electric
 field:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
E_{x} & = & e_{x}(t)cos[\omega t+\delta_{x}]\\
E_{y} & = & e_{y}(t)cos[\omega t+\delta_{y}]\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

by time averages of these electric field parameters:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
I & = & \left\langle e_{x}^{2}(t)\right\rangle +\left\langle e_{y}^{2}(t)\right\rangle \\
Q & = & \left\langle e_{x}^{2}(t)\right\rangle -\left\langle e_{y}^{2}(t)\right\rangle \\
U & = & 2\left\langle e_{x}(t)e_{y}(t)cos[\delta_{x}-\delta_{y}]\right\rangle \\
V & = & 2\left\langle e_{x}(t)e_{y}(t)sin[\delta_{x}-\delta_{y}]\right\rangle \end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

The parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 is a measure of the total power in the wave, 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 represent the linearly polarised components, and 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 represents the circularly polarised component.
 The Stokes parameters have the dimensions of flux density, and they combine
 additively for independent waves.

\begin_layout Section
Interferometry: Synthesis Imaging
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic idea: an astrophysical phenomenon takes places at location 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{R}$
\end_inset

, which causes a time-variable electric field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{R},t)$
\end_inset

.
 You can split this up into a Fourier Series of 
\emph on
quasi-monochromatic components,
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E_{\nu}}(\mathbf{R})$
\end_inset

, which are still complex quantities.
 The total response of an instrument will be the sum of all 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E_{\nu}}(\mathbf{R})$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Observed Electromagnetic Field
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because Maxwell's equations are linear, we can write the field at a location
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{r}$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mathbf{E_{\nu}}(\mathbf{r})=\int\int\int P_{\nu}(\mathbf{R},\mathbf{r})\mathbf{E_{\nu}}(\mathbf{R})dx\, dy\, dz.\end{equation}

\end_inset

Where 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathbf{R},\mathbf{r})$
\end_inset

 is a propagator function which describes how the electric field at 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{R}$
\end_inset

 affects the electric field at 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{r}$
\end_inset

.
 This simplifies to
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
E_{\nu}(\mathbf{r})=\int\varepsilon_{\nu}(\mathbf{R})\frac{e^{2\pi i\nu\left|\mathbf{R-r}\right|/c}}{\left|\mathbf{R-r}\right|}dS,\label{eq:electric field}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $dS$
\end_inset

 is an element of surface area on the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

celestial sphere
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{\nu}(\mathbf{R})$
\end_inset

 is the electric field on its surface.
 To get to this, we've made the following assumptions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All polarisation is ignored, so we can use scalar multiplication instead
 of tensors;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The sources are very far away, so all we can measure is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

surface brightness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 We introduce a celestial sphere which is between us and the source, and
 measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{\nu}(\mathbf{R})$
\end_inset

 on it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The space within the celestial sphere is empty, so the propagator is nice
 and easy and we can use Huygen's Principle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Equation
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:electric field"

\end_inset

 is the general form of the quasi-monochromatic component of the electric
 field at frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 due to all sources of cosmic electromagnetic radiation.
 We measure this to investigate the nature of bright things in the universe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Spatial Coherence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The correlation of the field at points 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{r_{1}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{r_{2}}$
\end_inset

 is defined as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
K_{\nu}(\mathbf{r_{1}},\mathbf{r_{2}})=\left\langle \mathbf{E_{\nu}}(\mathbf{r_{1}})\mathbf{E_{\nu}^{*}}(\mathbf{r_{2}})\right\rangle .\end{equation}

\end_inset

Subbing in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:electric field"

\end_inset

, and assuming that the radiation is not spatially coherent (so

\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \mathbf{E_{\nu}}(\mathbf{R_{1}})\mathbf{E_{\nu}^{*}}(\mathbf{R_{2}})\right\rangle =0$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{R_{1}\neq R_{2}}$
\end_inset

), this becomes
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
K_{\nu}(\mathbf{r_{1}},\mathbf{r_{2}})=\int\left\langle \left|\mathbf{\varepsilon_{\nu}}(\mathbf{r_{1}})\right|^{2}\right\rangle \left|\mathbf{R}\right|^{2}\frac{e^{2\pi i\nu\left|\mathbf{R-r_{1}}\right|/c}}{\left|\mathbf{R-r_{1}}\right|}\frac{e^{-2\pi i\nu\left|\mathbf{R-r_{2}}\right|/c}}{\left|\mathbf{R-r_{2}}\right|}dS\end{equation}

\end_inset

Finally, writing 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}$
\end_inset

 for the unit vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{R}/\left|\mathbf{R}\right|$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{\nu}(\mathbf{s})$
\end_inset

 for the observed intensity, then neglecting small terms of order 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{r/R}$
\end_inset

, and replacing 
\begin_inset Formula $dS$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\mathbf{R}\right|^{2}d\Omega$
\end_inset

, we approximate to
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
K_{\nu}(\mathbf{r_{1}},\mathbf{r_{2}})\approx\int I_{\nu}(\mathbf{s})e^{-2\pi i\nu\mathbf{s}.(\mathbf{r_{1}-}\mathbf{r_{2})/c}}d\Omega.\label{eq:spatial coherence fn}\end{equation}

 Note that we want to measure the seperation of

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{r_{2}}$
\end_inset

, not their absolute position, so we can hold one fixed and move the other
 around to investigate the correlation properties of the radiation field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Fourier Inversion of Synthesis Imaging
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The big whoop behind equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:spatial coherence fn"

\end_inset

 is that you can invert it to find the intensity distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 There are two possible assumptions we could choose (and build an interferometer
 accordingly):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Measurements Confined to a Plane
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we only measure in a plane, we can make up a coordinate system, conveniently
 in terms of the wavelength 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=c/\nu$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{r_{1}-r_{2}}=\lambda(u,v,0).\]

\end_inset

In these coordinates, the components of the unit vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}=(l,\, m,\,\sqrt{1-l^{2}-m^{2}})$
\end_inset

.
 Inserting these into equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:spatial coherence fn"

\end_inset

, we have
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
K_{\nu}(u,v,w=0)=\int\int I_{\nu}(l,m)\frac{e^{-2\pi i(ul+vm)}}{\sqrt{1-l^{2}-m^{2}}}dl\, dm,\end{equation}

\end_inset

which is a Fourier transform relation between the spatial coherence function
 and the intensity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
All Sources in a Small Region of Sky
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An alternate assumption is that all radiation comes from a small portion
 of the celestial sphere.
 We can then neglect small terms by writing 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}=\mathbf{s_{0}}+\sigma$
\end_inset

, then, stating both 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s_{0}}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}$
\end_inset

 are unit vectors we get that:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
1 & = & \left|\mathbf{s}\right|=\mathbf{s.s}=\mathbf{s_{0}.s_{0}}\\
 & = & \mathbf{s_{0}.s_{0}+2s_{0}}.\sigma+\sigma.\sigma\\
 & \approx & 1+2\mathbf{s_{0}}.\sigma\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Now, we can set a coordinate system 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s_{0}}=(0,0,1)$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{r_{1}-r_{2}}=(u,v,w).$
\end_inset

 From this we can get
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
K_{\nu}(u,v,w)=\int\int I_{\nu}(l,m)e^{-2\pi i(ul+vm)}dl\, dm,\label{eq:correlation-small-region}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 after absorbing a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-2\pi iw}$
\end_inset

 into 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 is the coherence function relative to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}_{\mathbf{0}}$
\end_inset

, which is called the 
\emph on
phase tracking centre.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The good news from this is that we can perform a direct Fourier inversion
 to get
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
I_{\nu}(l,m)=\int\int K_{\nu}(u,v)e^{2\pi i(ul+vm)}du\, dv.\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Effect of Discrete Sampling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So how do we take into account that we're not sampling everywhere on the
 u-v plane? Simple: we introduce a 
\emph on
sampling function 
\emph default

\begin_inset Formula $S(u,v)$
\end_inset

 which is zero everywhere we didn't take data.
 Then we can make up a 
\emph on
dirty image:
\emph default

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
I_{\nu}^{D}(l,m)=\int\int K_{\nu}(u,v)S(u,v)e^{2\pi i(ul+vm)}du\, dv,\end{equation}

\end_inset

 which is related to the desired intensity distribution by the convolution
 theorem
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
I_{\nu}^{D}=I_{\nu}*B.\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is the 
\emph on
synthesized beam
\emph default
, or 
\emph on
point-spread function 
\emph default
that corresponds to the sampling function 
\begin_inset Formula $S(u,v)$
\end_inset

.
 There are methods for undoing this convolution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Effect of Element Reception Pattern
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because interferometer elements aren't point sized, they are sensitive to
 the direction of arrival of radiation.
 So again, we introduce an additional term 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{\nu}(l,m)$
\end_inset

, which is the 
\emph on
primary beam
\emph default
, or 
\emph on
normalised reception pattern.
 
\emph default
Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:complex-visibility"

\end_inset

 then becomes
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
K_{\nu}(u,v,w)=\int\int\mathcal{A}_{\nu}(l,m)I_{\nu}(l,m)e^{-2\pi i(ul+vm)}dl\, dm,\label{eq:complex-visibility}\end{equation}

\end_inset

which we call the 
\emph on
complex visibility.

\emph default
 It actually turns out that the reception pattern is a boon, because it
 makes the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

small patch of sky
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 assumption a reality, as in most telescopes this rapidly falls to zero
 outside the phase tracking centre.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Extensions to the Basic Theory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two noteworthy extensions to this basic theory of synthesis imaging
 that we should run through.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Spectroscopy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we're looking at a spectral line, chances are that it'll change quite
 rapidly as a function of frequency.
 The best way to deal with this is by using digital stuff and calculate
 the correlation as a function of lag.
 We add in the lag as a complex phase shift:
\begin_inset Formula \[
V(u,v,\tau)=\int V(u,v,\nu)e^{2\pi i\tau\nu}d\nu,\]

\end_inset

which is an easily inverted Fourier transform.
 In terms of digitised data, we have to deal with 
\begin_inset Formula \[
V(u,v,j\Delta\nu)=\Sigma_{k}V(u,v,k\Delta\tau)e^{-2\pi ijk\Delta\nu\Delta\tau},\]

\end_inset

 so require some Fourier sampling theory.
 Examining this, we see the replication interval is 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\Delta\tau$
\end_inset

, which means that we have to restrict our band of frequencies 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 sampling to a total bandwidth less than this, to avoid losing information
 in the sampling process.
 Normally you'd expect a 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2\Delta\tau$
\end_inset

 requirement; the factor of 2 comes in because we've got a complex quantity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Polarimetry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Earlier, we decided to ignore polarisation so we can work with scalar fields.
 When looking at electromagnetic noise, polarisation is defined by a correlation
 process: you pick two orthogonal polarisations and analyse the tge radiation
 of the quasi-monochromatic wave into the components of these two polarisations.
 For example, if we pick right and left circular polarisation as our orthogonal
 modes, we can write a 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times2$
\end_inset

 matrix of correlations.
 We can match this up to the Stokes parameters such that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\begin{array}{cc}
RR^{*} & RL^{*}\\
LR^{*} & LL^{*}\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
I+V & Q+iU\\
Q-iU & I-V\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset

which is useful for calibration and retrieving polarisation data.

 Assuming equipartition and assigning a total energy per degree of freedom
 of

\begin_inset Formula \[

If we take the energy per degree of freedom to be that arising from Planck's

Thermal noise is the most basic type of noise, being caused by thermal vibration
 of bound charges.
 Also known as Johnson or Nyquist noise.
 Consider a resistor at a temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T$

\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 The electrons in this resistor are in random motion, with a kinetic energy
 that is proportional to the temperature, 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 These random motions produce small, random voltage fluctuations at the
 resistor terminals, and while the voltage has zero average value, it has
 a nonzero rms value given by Planck's black body radiation law,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
V_{n}=\sqrt{\frac{4hf_{c}R\Delta\nu}{e^{hf_{c}/kT}-1}},\label{eq:planck_bb}\end{equation}

\begin_inset Formula $k=1.380\times10^{-23}JK^{-1}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $R$

 is the resistance, in

 At microwave frequencies the above case can be simplified by making use
 of the fact that for microwave frequencies 
\begin_inset Formula $hf\ll kT$
\end_inset

.
 Using the first two terms of a Taylor series expansion for the exponential
 gives
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}

Measuring Noise Temperature

\begin_layout Standard
A common technique for measuring the equivalent noise temperature is the
 
\emph on
Y-factor method.
 
\emph default
In this technique, two matched loads at different temperatures 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{1}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $T_{2}$

 are connected to the device under test (DUT), and the output power is measured
 for each case, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{2}$
\end_inset

, respectively.
 The output power consists of noise power generated by the DUT and the noise
 power from the source resistor.
 Thus we have
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
N_{1} & = & GkT_{1}\Delta\nu+GkT_{e}\Delta\nu,\\
N_{2} & = & GkT_{2}\Delta\nu+GkT_{e}\Delta\nu,\end{eqnarray}

Y=\frac{N_{1}}{N_{2}}=\frac{T_{1}+T_{e}}{T_{2}+T_{e}}>1\end{equation}

 Then we can solve for the equivalent noise temperature, which will be 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
T_{2}=\frac{T_{1}-YT_{2}}{Y-1}\end{equation}

\begin_layout Standard
An alternative characterisation is the 
\emph on
noise figure
\emph default
 of the DUT, which is a measure of the degradation in the signal-to-noise
 ratio between the input and the output of the component.
 The noise figure, 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

, is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
F=\frac{S_{i}/N_{i}}{S_{0}/N_{0}}\ge1,\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{i}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{i}$
\end_inset

 are the input signal and noise powers, and 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{0},$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{0}$
\end_inset

 are the output signal and noise powers.
 By definition, the input noise power is assumed to be the noise power resulting
 from a matched resistor at 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{0}=290K$
\end_inset

 ; that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{i}=kT_{0}\Delta\nu$
\end_inset

.
 The noise figure is related to the effective temperature by the equation
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
T_{e} & = & T_{0}(F-1)\\
 & = & T_{0}(10^{F_{dB}/10}-1),\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

if the noise figure is quoted in decibels (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{dB}$
\end_inset

 ).

\begin_layout Paragraph
Noise Figure of a Cascaded System
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a typical microwave system the input signal travels through a cascade
 of many different components, each of which may degrade the dignal-to-noise
 ratio to some degree.
 If we know the noise figure (or noise temperature) of the individual stages,
 we can determine the noise figure (or noise temperature) of the cascade
 connection of stages.
 We will see that the noise performance of the first stage is usually the
 most critical, an interesting result that is very important in practice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the cascade of two components, having gains 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{2}$
\end_inset

, noise figures 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{2}$
\end_inset

, and noise temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{e1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{e2}$
\end_inset

.
 We wish to find the overall noise figure and noise temperature of the cascade,
 as if it were a single component.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using noise temperatures, the noise power at the output of the first stage
 is
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
N_{1}=G_{1}kT_{0}\Delta\nu+G_{1}kT_{e1}\Delta\nu,\end{equation}

\end_inset

the noise power at the output of the second stage is
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
N_{0} & = & G_{2}N_{1}+G_{2}kT_{e2}\Delta\nu\label{eq:noise_two_stg}\\
 & = & G_{1}G_{2}k\Delta\nu(T_{0}+T_{e1}+\frac{1}{G_{1}}T_{e2}).\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

For the equivalent system (NOTE: see figure 10.9), we have 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
N_{0}=G_{1}G_{2}k\Delta\nu(T_{cas}+T_{0}),\end{equation}

\end_inset

so comparison with Eq
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:noise_two_stg"

\end_inset

 gives the noise temperature of the cascade system as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
T_{cas}=T_{e1}+\frac{1}{G_{1}}T_{e2}.\end{equation}

\end_inset

Thus the noise characteristics of a cascaded system are dominated by the
 characteristics of the first stage, since the effect of the second stage
 is reduced by the gain of the first.
 We can generalise this result to an arbitrary number of stages, such that
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
T_{cas}=T_{e1}+\frac{T_{e2}}{G_{1}}+\frac{T_{e3}}{G_{1}G_{2}}+...\end{equation}

\end_inset
